# android-hello-world
Example project for [Cowpox](https://github.com/combatopera/Cowpox)

## Quick start
* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your platform
    * Follow the installation instructions up until you can `docker run hello-world`
* Get [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) if you don't already have it
* Install scripts using `pip3 install --user Cowpox`
* If you're reading this on GitHub, now is the time to clone the repository
* Then `Cowpox` will make an APK (this will take a while)
    * As part of this process an image is downloaded from Docker Hub, for which about a gigabyte of disk space is needed
* You can also `python3 launch.py` to test locally without building an APK
